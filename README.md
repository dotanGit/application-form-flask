# Flask Form Application
This is a simple Flask application that allows users to submit a form with their personal details, such as first name, last name, email, date of birth, and occupation. 
The form data is stored in a SQLite database and an email notification is sent to the user upon successful submission of the form.

### Usage
To run the application, run the following command in the terminal:

python app.py

You can also run this program in your virtual machine.

This will start the Flask development server on port 5001. You can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:5001 in your web browser.
